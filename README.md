# Rock, Paper, Scissors


#### By Frank Ngo

## Description

A program to test if a set of words are anagrams of another word.

## Specifications

Recreate the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. For anyone who has never played it, here are the rules:

* It is played by 2 people. Each person chooses "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" by forming a shape with their hand.
* They choose at the same time, so that each person doesn't know what the other person has picked.
* If one person chooses "Rock" and the other person picks "Scissors" then "Rock" wins. It's a game of combinations:

Rock v. Scissors = Rock wins
Rock v. Paper = Paper wins
Paper v. Scissors = Scissors wins

* If both people choose the same thing, then it is a draw and nobody wins.

Write a method that can handle the different combinations of plays and make sure to write specs for all possible combination of plays. Your method should take 2 inputs - one for each player's choice. It should return "Player 1" if the first input wins, "Player 2" if the second input wins, and "Draw" if nobody wins.
